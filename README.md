## Customer-Loyalty-Prediction-and-Profit-Maximization

### Problem:
The problem addressed in this project is predicting whether customers will return to the store for consumption based on their characteristics.

### Objective:
The objective of this project is to use the logistic regression model to predict customer loyalty and establish a business model to provide remedial measures for customers with lower loyalty. The project also aims to find the optimal threshold that maximizes profit and the best use of funds through the business model.

### Method:
The project uses bank data and the logistic regression model to predict customer loyalty. A business model is then established to determine the optimal threshold for the model's classification results. Precision and recall indicators are used to evaluate the classification performance of different model thresholds, and hypotheses are made for the cost, success rate, and subsequent benefits of remedial measures. The optimal threshold that maximizes profit and the best use of funds is found by combining the business model with the model's predictive results.

### Summary:
This project aims to predict customer loyalty and establish a business model to provide remedial measures for customers with lower loyalty. It uses the logistic regression model and precision and recall indicators to evaluate the classification performance of different model thresholds. The project also aims to find the optimal threshold that maximizes profit and the best use of funds through the business model.
